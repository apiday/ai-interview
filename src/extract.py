def extract_esg_info(text: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Parse raw PDF text and return a nested dict matching schema.DocESG.

    This function should implement robust string handling to extract ESG information
    from unstructured PDF text. Key areas to focus on:

    1. Company identification and reporting year
    2. Board composition and governance structure
    3. GHG emissions data (Scope 1, 2, 3) with proper unit handling
    4. Policy identification using synonyms (e.g., "Speak-Up" -> whistleblowing)
    5. Handle missing data gracefully with None values

    Implementation suggestions:
    - Use regex patterns to find section headers and numeric data
    - Implement fuzzy matching for policy names and board member roles
    - Parse tables and structured data sections
    - Handle different date/year formats
    - Extract numeric values with proper unit conversion

    Args:
        text: Raw text extracted from PDF

    Returns:
        Dictionary matching DocESG schema structure with extracted ESG data
